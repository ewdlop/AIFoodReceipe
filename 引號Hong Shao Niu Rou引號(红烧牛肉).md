# "Hong Shao Niu Rou" (红烧牛肉)

Chinese Beef Stew, often referred to as "Hong Shao Niu Rou" (红烧牛肉), is a traditional and flavorful dish known for its rich, savory, and slightly sweet taste. It's typically slow-cooked to achieve tender, melt-in-your-mouth beef and is often enjoyed during colder months. Here’s a recipe to make this comforting dish:

Ingredients:
2 lbs beef chuck or brisket, cut into 1-2 inch cubes
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3-4 slices of ginger
2-3 cloves of garlic, smashed
2 star anise
1 cinnamon stick
2-3 bay leaves
1/4 cup Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
3 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
2-3 tablespoons oyster sauce
2 tablespoons rock sugar or regular sugar
4-5 cups water or beef broth
2-3 large carrots, cut into large chunks
2-3 medium potatoes, cut into large chunks (optional)
Salt and pepper, to taste
Green onions and cilantro for garnish (optional)
Instructions:
Blanch the Beef:

Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add beef and boil for a few minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse the beef.
Sauté Aromatics:

Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add ginger, garlic, star anise, cinnamon stick, and bay leaves. Sauté until fragrant.
Brown the Beef:

Add the blanched beef to the pot. Cook until the beef is lightly browned on all sides.
Add Liquids and Seasonings:

Pour in Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, oyster sauce, and rock sugar. Stir well.
Add water or beef broth until it just covers the beef. Bring to a boil.
Simmer the Stew:

Reduce heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.
Add Vegetables:

When the beef is tender, add the carrots (and potatoes if using).
Simmer until the vegetables are cooked through, about 30 minutes.
Final Seasoning and Garnish:

Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.
If the stew is too liquid, you can increase the heat and reduce it to your desired thickness.
Garnish with chopped green onions and cilantro before serving.
Serve:

Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles.
Enjoy your homemade Chinese Beef Stew! This dish is perfect for a cozy, heartwarming meal.
