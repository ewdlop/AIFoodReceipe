"Steamed Fish, the Chinese Way" (清蒸鱼) is a classic and beloved dish in Chinese cuisine known for its simplicity, delicate flavors, and healthful preparation method. Here's a basic recipe to make this dish:

Ingredients:
1 whole white fish (such as sea bass, tilapia, or snapper), cleaned and scaled
2-3 green onions, finely sliced
1-2 inches of fresh ginger, julienned
1-2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced (optional)
2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce
1 tablespoon of Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
1 teaspoon of sesame oil
Fresh cilantro, for garnish
Salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Instructions:
Prepare the Fish: Make a few diagonal cuts on both sides of the fish. This helps the fish cook more evenly and allows the flavors to penetrate. Season the fish inside and out with salt and pepper.

Steam the Fish:

Place the fish on a heatproof plate that fits inside a steamer.
Sprinkle half of the ginger and some green onions on and inside the fish.
Bring water in the steamer to a boil, then place the plate with the fish inside. Cover and steam for about 8-10 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. The fish is done when the flesh flakes easily with a fork.
Prepare the Sauce:

While the fish is steaming, combine soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and sesame oil in a small bowl.
Check the Fish: Once the fish is done, carefully remove the plate from the steamer. Pour any accumulated water out of the plate.

Garnish and Serve:

Scatter the remaining ginger, green onions, and garlic (if using) over the fish.
Heat a small amount of oil in a pan until it's very hot, then pour it over the fish to bring out the aroma of the ginger and green onion.
Pour the prepared sauce over the fish.
Garnish with fresh cilantro.
Serve immediately with steamed rice.
Enjoy your delicious, healthy, and traditional Chinese steamed fish!
