sautéed mushrooms, a versatile dish that can be used as a side, a topping for steaks or burgers, or even as an addition to pastas and salads.

Ingredients:
500g (about 1 pound) of your preferred mushrooms (button, cremini, portobello, etc.), cleaned and sliced
2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter
2 cloves of garlic, minced
Salt and pepper, to taste
Optional: 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, or rosemary), chopped
Optional: A splash of white wine or balsamic vinegar
Instructions:
Heat the Oil/Butter: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.

Cook the Mushrooms: Add the mushrooms to the skillet. Sauté them until they are golden brown and have released their moisture, about 5-7 minutes.

Add Garlic and Seasonings: Add the minced garlic to the mushrooms. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant but not burnt. If you're using herbs, add them now.

Deglaze (Optional): If you like, add a splash of white wine or balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan. This will add a nice depth of flavor. Cook for another minute or so, until the liquid mostly evaporates.

Season: Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve: Serve the mushrooms hot as a side dish, or use them as a topping or ingredient in another dish.

This recipe is simple yet flavorful, and you can always modify it to match your taste preferences or the ingredients you have on hand. Enjoy your meal!
